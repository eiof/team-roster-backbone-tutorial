Collection Datalist Widget!
=====

This widget takes a collection and turns it to a datalist! It can do cool things such as syncing with a collection on the fly, calling a callback when a model from the collection is selected, and backflips (not really).

The following is what you may want to pass in:

* `data`: The collection object.
* `modelValue`: Value shown in a datalist option.
* `onChangeCallback`: Callback function that accepts a variable that contains the selected `modelValue`.
